# FTP Upload Test Script for Docker Inception Project
# ==============================================================================
# This script tests the FTP service functionality by:
# 1. Creating a test file locally
# 2. Uploading it to the FTP server via FTPS (SSL/TLS)
# 3. Verifying the file exists on the server
# 4. Cleaning up test files
# 
# The FTP server is configured with:
# - SSL/TLS encryption enabled
# - Self-signed certificates (development environment)
# - User authentication required
# - Files stored in /var/www/html (shared with WordPress and Nginx)
# ==============================================================================

# ANSI color codes for formatted output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'  # Success messages
RED='\033[0;31m'    # Error messages
BLUE='\033[0;34m'   # Information headers
NC='\033[0m'        # No Color (reset)

# ==============================================================================
# FTP Server Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# These settings match the .env file and docker-compose.yml configuration
FTP_HOST="localhost"        # FTP server address (Docker container mapped to localhost)
FTP_USER="marco"           # Username from .env file (FTP_USER variable)
FTP_PASSWORD="1234"        # Password from .env file (FTP_PASSWORD variable)

# Step 1: Create Test File
# ==============================================================================
# WARNING: Current path "/test.jpeg" will try to create file in root directory
# This requires root permissions and may fail. Better to use /tmp/test.jpeg

# ==============================================================================
# Step 2: Upload File to FTP Server
# ==============================================================================
# Using lftp client with the following options:
# - "set ssl:verify-certificate no" : Accept self-signed certificates
# - "put $TEST_FILE" : Upload the local file to server
# - "quit" : Close FTP session
# - "-u user,pass" : Authenticate with username and password
# - "2>/dev/null" : Suppress error messages for cleaner output
